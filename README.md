# prnt.sc_Screenshot_Scraper
Scraper of all screenshots saved in lightshot (prnt.sc)

This program scrapes the saved screenshots in prnt.sc. The images are saved in local folder output. It uses threads to execute.

Please consider scraping may be ILLEGAL. You can control the quantity of images downloaded editing the count variable. Currently it is set at 1000.

The code is originally from https://github.com/mitchelljy/Prntsc_Scraper but i made the code run faster using threads, about half of the time, and the code was not working because of some components changed and also the urls are changed.
